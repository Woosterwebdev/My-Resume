    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Spending time with my family</h2>
    <p>
      I love spending time with my wife and daughter. Whether it be going out to
      Sushi or hitting a local arcade, I always have a wonderful time. And my
      daughter loves to use all the "tickets" we win to add to her ever
      expanding horde of stuffies.
    </p>
    <h2>Cars</h2>
    <p>
      I love working on cars. Whether it has an electic motor or
      internalcombustion engine (ice) I have always enjoyed the ability to fix
      or restore a car to near factory condition. In some cases even better than
      factory condition.
    </p>
    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <p>
      I built my first custom PC in 1999. Much like cars I have enjoyed all the
      possiblities of what one can create. And the challenge to fix that which
      defies all logic or understanding when it comes to Windows.
    </p>
    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
    <p>
      I was recently given an Ender 3 Pro and fell down a wormhole that is 3D
      printing. It is true what they say. You will print more items for your
      print than anything else.
